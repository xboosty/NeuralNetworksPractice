README: Neural Network Model for MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification
Overview
This script implements a neural network to classify handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset, a standard dataset used in deep learning for image classification. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras, popular libraries for deep learning in Python.

How the Script Works
Import Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, matplotlib for visualization, and numpy for numerical operations.

Load Dataset: The MNIST dataset is loaded directly from TensorFlow's dataset library. It includes 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits.

Preprocess Data: The images are normalized to have pixel values between 0 and 1 for more efficient training. The labels (digits 0-9) are one-hot encoded, turning them into a binary matrix representation.

Build the Neural Network:

A simple sequential model is defined with two layers.
The first layer is a Flatten layer to transform the 28x28 pixel images into a 1D array.
The second is a Dense layer with 128 neurons and ReLU activation function.
The output layer has 10 neurons (one for each digit) with a softmax activation function to output probability distributions.
Compile the Model: The model uses the Adam optimizer, categorical cross-entropy as the loss function, and tracks accuracy as a performance metric.

Train the Model: The model is trained over 5 epochs with a validation split of 20% to monitor performance on unseen data.

Evaluate the Model: Post training, the model is evaluated on the test set to determine its accuracy.

Make Predictions and Visualize: The model makes predictions on the test set, and a custom function plots these predictions alongside the actual images for a visual comparison.

Output Explanation
Training Output:

Each epoch shows the training loss (loss), training accuracy (accuracy), validation loss (val_loss), and validation accuracy (val_accuracy).
These metrics indicate how well the model is learning and generalizing.
Final Test Accuracy:

The script outputs the accuracy of the model on the test dataset (Test Accuracy).
A high accuracy, as seen in your output (~97.76%), indicates that the model performs well in recognizing and classifying unseen handwritten digits.
Practical Significance
This script provides a practical example of a basic neural network in action. It demonstrates key concepts like data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation, crucial for understanding and developing skills in deep learning and neural networks.

Conclusion
Running this script gives hands-on experience with neural network models and serves as an excellent starting point for further exploration into more complex deep learning tasks and architectures.
